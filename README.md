# Terraform examples
---

This repository contains some practical examples of using Terrafrom to write, plan and create Infrastructure as Code.

Terraform enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It is an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.

In my examples, I will use providers such as AWS and Docker.
